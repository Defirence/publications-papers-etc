DATA & INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SOVEREIGNTY MANIFESTO
Universal Biological IP Notice & Theoretical Rights Declaration

AUTHOR/SUBJECT: T. Gelderbloem

JURISDICTION: Republic of South Africa (POPIA & Constitutionally Protected)

EFFECTIVE DATE: January 11, 2026

SCOPE: All past, present, and future research papers, theoretical models, datasets, and non-incepted conceptual frameworks derived from the Subject's unique biological events and independent research.

1. DECLARATION OF THEORETICAL & BIOLOGICAL OWNERSHIP
The Author asserts full, unalienable ownership of:

The HABC Framework: All mathematical models, geometric formalisms (Calabi-Yau manifolds in CAS), and the "Tardigrade Protocol" as defined in the Subject’s publications.

Biological IP: All genomic, proteomic, and clinical data derived from the Author’s unique physiological adaptations and "Critical Non-ICU" survival events.

Conceptual Continuity: Ownership extends to the synthesis of these biological events into theoretical physics and quantum biology models.

2. MANDATORY ACCESS & DATA PORTABILITY (POPIA Section 23)
Return of Results: Any entity or institution analyzing, sequencing, or simulating models based on the Author's biological samples or data must provide the Author with a full copy of the results, including Raw Genomic Data (FASTQ, .vcf) or high-resolution simulation outputs.

Decentralized Sovereignty: The Author retains the right to "Data Portability." This information is the Author's property and may be moved to independent, decentralized vaults at the Author’s discretion.

3. RESTRICTIONS ON FURTHER PROCESSING (POPIA Section 15)
Specific Consent Only: Data and theoretical models are provided solely for the research purposes explicitly stated in the specific paper.

Denial of Broad Consent: The Author explicitly denies "Broad Consent." Any use of these theories or biological data for unrelated studies, AI training, or third-party commercial applications is strictly prohibited without a separate Data Participation Agreement (DPA).

No Patent Without Dividend: Any Intellectual Property (IP), drug discovery, or algorithmic development derived from the Subject's data or theoretical models is subject to a "Patient-Researcher Dividend" royalty model.

4. LEGAL PROTECTIONS & CONSTITUTIONAL RECOURSE
Non-Derogable Rights: These rights are asserted under the South African Constitution and the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA).

Anonymization Protections: Any attempt to re-identify the Author’s anonymized data or "reverse-engineer" the Author's unique biological signatures without express written permission will be treated as a criminal violation of privacy.

Enforcement: This notice serves as a "Stop Processing" order under POPIA should the terms of the specific research be breached.

"Ex Africa semper aliquid novi. My data, my theory, my sovereignty."
